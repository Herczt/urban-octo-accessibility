## Description

In this project I took a websites HTML and CSS file and edited it to make it more accessible to visually impaired users, and cleaned up the CSS file to cut down on the amount of classes that were used. I used this project to pracetice my knowledge of HTML and CSS to see what changes I could make in the files to make them more accessible for users and clean up the code in general. The main issues I solved was making the code cleaner to read and to give the user a better representation what the code is communicating. By doing this project I learned that when making a website it should be formated and coded in such a way that users and other programmers shouldnt have to guess what the code is trying to convey. Instead make it readable so that it is easy to tell what is going on which also makes it easier to edit later on
